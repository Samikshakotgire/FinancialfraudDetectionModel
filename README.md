# FinancialfraudDetectionModel
Overview
This project focuses on detecting financial fraud using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset used contains transactional data with features such as transaction type, amount, and balance changes. The goal is to develop effective models that can accurately classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

Dataset


The dataset used in this project consists of transactional data containing the following features:

Transaction type (e.g., debit, credit)
Transaction amount
Balance changes
Other relevant transaction details
Methodology
Preprocessing
Data cleaning: One-hot encoding and data normalization.
Feature engineering: Dropping irrelevant features.


Model Selection
The project explores both traditional machine learning models and deep learning architectures for classification:

Machine Learning Models:
1.Logistic Regression
2.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model Training and Evaluation
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training each model using the training data.
Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Comparing the performance of different models to identify the most effective ones for fraud detection.
Results
Among the machine learning models, the Random Forest classifier demonstrated the best performance based on evaluation metrics.

Detailed analysis and interpretation of model performance, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.
